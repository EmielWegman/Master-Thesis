# Description of repository
This repository contains the notebook that I used to test my master thesis hypotheses. The main objective of this project was to add new insights to the literature of service innovation and servitization, and to pass my master thesis. The 'Hypothesis testing.ipynb' file contains my Python notebook for testing and visualizing statistic models in order to test the hypotheses. The 'Description of variables in dataset.pdf' file contains a description of all the variables in the dataset. The 'All hypotheses.pdf' file contains a table with an overview of my hypotheses and whether they are supported or not. The 'Final Thesis Emiel Wegman 30062020.pdf' file contains my entire master thesis.
