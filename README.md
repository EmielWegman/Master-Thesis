# Hypothesis-Testing-Thesis
This repository contains the code that I used to test the hypotheses that I conducted for my master thesis. The main objective of this project was to add new insights to the literature of service innovation and servitization, and to pass my master thesis. Since this project was created from an academic research perspectice, it is mostly focused inferential statistics. The 'Hypothesis testing.ipynb' file contains my code for testing and visualizing the models of my hypotheses. The 'Dataset thesis Emiel Wegman 30062020.xlsx' contains the dataset that I created for my hypothesis testing, this dataset was created by myself with publicly available data from Compustat and Patentsview databases. The 'Description of variables in dataset.pdf' file contains a description of all the variables in the dataset. The 'All hypotheses.pdf' file contains a table with an overview of my hypotheses and whether they are supported or not. The 'Final Thesis Emiel Wegman 30062020.pdf' file contains my entire master thesis, but is not necessary to read in order to understand my code.
